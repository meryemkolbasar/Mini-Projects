The code aims to receive user input and process it accordingly.
It prompts the user to enter a response (either 'a', 'b', or 'c') and based on the input, performs specific actions.

If the user enters 'a', it displays the message "Your request is being processed."
If the user enters 'b', it displays the message "Thank you for your interest anyway."
If the user enters 'c', it displays the message "Sorry, there is currently no assistance available."
For any other input, it displays the message "Invalid input, please try again!"

The code utilizes the Scanner class to capture user input from the console
and it closes the Scanner object at the end to release associated resources.

Please note that the code assumes the user will provide valid input in the expected format.
