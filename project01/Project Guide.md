1 - Open your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA.

2 - Create a new Java project with the name "github_projects.project01" or any other name you prefer. This will create the necessary project structure for your code.

3 - Inside the project, create a new Java class called "MinuteCalculator". This class will contain your main method and the logic for calculating years and days from minutes.

4 - Import the necessary Java utility class "Scanner" by adding the following line at the beginning of your code: 

` import java.util.Scanner; `

5 - Declare the main method inside the "MinuteCalculator" class. It should have the following signature:

`public static void main(String[] args)`

6 - Create a new instance of the Scanner class to read input from the user. Add the following line inside the main method:

`Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);`

7 - Prompt the user to enter the number of minutes. Use the `System.out.println()` method to display a message. Then, use the `nextInt()` method of the Scanner class to read the user's input as an integer. Store the value in the `minutes` variable. Add the following lines of code:

`System.out.println("Please enter the number of minutes:");
int minutes = scan.nextInt();`

8 - Calculate the number of years and remaining minutes from the given input. Use the appropriate mathematical operations to perform the calculations. Add the following lines of code:

`int years = minutes / 525600;
int remainingMinutes = minutes % 525600;`

9 - Calculate the number of days from the remaining minutes. Use the appropriate mathematical operations again. Add the following line of code:

`int days = remainingMinutes / 1440;`

10 - Finally, display the result to the user using the `System.out.println()` method. Add the following line of code:

`System.out.println(minutes + " minutes is approximately " + years + " years and " + days + " days.");`

11 - Save your code and run the program. You can do this by clicking the "Run" or "Play" button in your IDE.

12 - Test your program by entering different values for the number of minutes and verify that the calculated years and days are displayed correctly.

**That's it! You have successfully created a Java program that calculates the approximate number of years and days from a given number of minutes. Feel free to customize and enhance the code according to your requirements.**
