The AdditionProgram is a Java program that performs addition between two numbers.
It prompts the user to enter two numbers and calculates their sum.
The program then checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it displays the sum of the entered values.
However, if the sum exceeds the value of 999999999, it displays an "Overflow" message.
This program allows users to quickly add two numbers and
provides overflow protection by ensuring the sum is within a specific range.
