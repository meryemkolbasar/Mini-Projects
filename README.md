<h2> Mini Projects </h2>
<p>This is my personal GitHub repository that showcases a collection of mini projects I have implemented in Java. These projects cover a wide range of topics and are designed to cater to different skill levels, from beginners like myself to intermediate developers. Each project has its own dedicated folder and includes a README file with detailed installation instructions and a brief usage guide. I have curated this collection as a valuable resource for anyone looking to practice programming, learn new concepts, and explore the world of Java development. Feel free to delve into these mini projects and have fun experimenting!</p>
