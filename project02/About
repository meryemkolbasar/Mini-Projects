The OverflowControlledAdditionProgram is a Java program that allows the user to input
two numbers and calculates their sum.
It includes an overflow control mechanism to prevent unexpected behavior.
If the sum of the two numbers is within the range of 0 or greater and less than 999999999, it displays the sum.
However, if the sum exceeds this limit, it shows an "Overflow" message.
This program ensures that the addition operation is performed safely within the specified range.
