**1 - Create a new Java project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).**

**2 - Create a new package named `github_projects.project11` within your project.**

**3 -  Inside the package, create a new Java class named `P01IfElse`.**

**4 - Add the necessary import statement at the beginning of the class to import the `Scanner` class:**

`import java.util.Scanner;`

**5 - Define the main method within the `P01IfElse` class:**

`public static void main(String[] args) {
// Your code will go here
}`

**6 - Create a new `Scanner` object to read input from the user:**

`Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);`

**7 - Prompt the user to enter the first number:**

`System.out.println("Enter the first number:");`

**8 - Read the first number entered by the user and store it in an `int` variable named `firstNumber`:**

`int firstNumber = scan.nextInt();`

**9 - Prompt the user to enter the second number:**

`System.out.println("Enter the second number:");`

**10 - Read the second number entered by the user and store it in an `int` variable named `secondNumber`:**

`int secondNumber = scan.nextInt();`

**11 - Use an `if-else` statement to compare the two numbers and print the appropriate message:**

`if (firstNumber > secondNumber) {
System.out.println("The first number is greater than the second number.");
} else {
System.out.println("The first number is not greater than the second number.");
}`

**12 - Congratulations! You have successfully created the project. Run it to test the functionality.**
